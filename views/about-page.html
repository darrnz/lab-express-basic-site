    <h1>DOGE</h1>
    
        <article><img src="/images/king.png" alt="doge"><p>The meme is based on a 2010 photograph, 
            and became popular in late 2013, being named as Know Your Meme's "top meme" of that year. 
            A cryptocurrency based on Doge, the Dogecoin, was launched in December 2013,
             and the Shiba Inu has been featured on Josh Wise's NASCAR car as part of a sponsorship deal. 
             Doge has also been referenced by members of the United States Congress, a safety video for Delta Air Lines, 
             a Google Easter egg, and the video for the song "Word Crimes" by "Weird Al" Yankovic. 
             Toward the end of the decade, the meme saw a resurgence in popularity.
             Several online polls and media outlets recognized Doge as one of the best Internet memes of the 2010s.
